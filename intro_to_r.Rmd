# R as a Calculator

You can use R to do basic math! R follows the order of operations (PEMDAS), so use parentheses appropriately!

* `+`: addition
* `-`: subtraction
* `/`: division
* `^`: exponentiation

# Assignment & Variables

When doing algebra, we used `X` to represent some number. Similarly, we can assign variables in R using the `<-` assignment operator.

Let's solve a simple linear formula! Remember, `y = mx + b`
```{r}
m <- 3        # set slope
x <- 10       # set x value
b <- 7        # set intercept

y <- m*x + b  # identify y value

y             # print the value of y
```

# Variables with multiple values

Variables can take on a number of values. In R, this is a called a vector. Vectors can only take on one data type (i.e. numeric, character, or logical).

We define a vector with the `c()` function (combine). Each element is separated by a comma. We can apply an operation to each element of a vector. 

```{r}
x <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) # first 5 prime numbers
m <- 3                 # set slope
b <- 7                 # set intercept 

y <- m*x + b           # solve for y

y                      # identify value of y for each value of x
```

# Building SQL-like tables using vectors

We can build tables like we find in SQL using vectors. Each vector will become it's own column. Tables in R are called `data frames`. 

We build them using the `data.frame()` function. Each argument is a new column. 

Example structure:
```{r, eval = F}
data.frame(
  col_name  = values,
  col_name2 = values
)
```

# Building a Data Frame


```{r}
x <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
y <- 3*x + 7 

data.frame(
  x = x,
  y = y
)
```

# Using Packages & the Tidyverse

* R relies on packages for more functionality. 
* There is the **[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**, a collection of packages used for data manipulation.
* Install packages using `install.packages("package_name")`.
* Load packages using `library(package_name)`.

```{r eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


# SQL functionality with the Tidyverse: selecting

* `select()` selects specified columns from a data frame.
  * `select(data_frame, column_name)`

### Star Wars!

* `tidyverse` package has a built in data frame called `starwars`
  * Type `starwars` into your console to print it

# Selecting Star Wars Characters

* Use the `select()` function on the `starwars` data set to select:
  * `name, height, & mass` columns and assign it to `star_chars`

```{r}
star_chars <- select(starwars, name, height, mass)
star_chars
```


# Making & Modifying New Columns: `mutate()`

* New columns can be created using the `mutate()` function. 
   * `mutate(data_frame, new_col = operation)`
* Calculate the ratio of mass to height, call this mh_ratio

```{r}
star_chars <- mutate(star_chars, mh_ratio = mass / height)
star_chars
```

# Chaining Functions using the Pipe (`%>%`)

<img src="images/magritte.jpg" width="900px"/>


# `%>%`

* The pipe allows you to chain functions together.
* Sends data frome the left, to the right
* Since `data_frame` is the first argument of almost all of the functions in the **tidyverse** you can chain these function together. 


```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, mass, height) %>% 
  mutate(mh_ratio = mass / height)
```


# Filtering data: `filter()`

`filter()` allows us to narrow down our observations based on a series of logical statements.

Logical operators:

* `<` : less than
* `>` : greater than
* `<=` : less than or equal to
* `>=` : greater than or equal to
* `==`: equal to
* `!=`: not equal to

# Filtering `mh_ratio`

Let's build upon our previous chain and identify all characters with a `mh_ratio` that is greater than `0.5`

```{r}
star_chars %>% 
  filter(mh_ratio > .5)
```

# Reading Data from Flat Files

* Most flat files you use will be `csv`s. 
* Each value is a separated by a comma. 
* In order to read these files, we will use the function `read_csv()`. 

```{r message=FALSE}
election <- read_csv("data/2016_election.csv")
head(election)
```

# Exercise!

#### How many votes were cast for all three candidates in each state?

```{r}
mutate(election, total_votes = clinton + trump + johnson)
```

# Let's Play a Game of What If

#### What if everyone who voted for Gary Johnson Voted for Hillary Clinton? 
An exploration of the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect)

* Create a new object called `what_if` that has:
  * a column called `clinton_johnson` which is the sum of the two candidates' votes.
  * a new variable called `clinton_win` which checks to see if Clinton had more votes than Trump
  
```{r}
what_if <- election %>% 
  mutate(clinton_johnson = clinton + johnson,
         clinton_win = clinton_johnson > trump)
```
  

# Aggregating: `summarise()`

### How many total electoral votes were cast?

* To answer this we need to aggregate our data, the `summarise()` function does this. 
* Groups all rows together and performs an operation on them. 
* Think of this as the grouped `mutate()`

```{r}
what_if %>% 
  summarise(total_ev = sum(electoral_votes)) # 538 is the correct answer btw
```

# Back to the Game: `group_by()`

* What if we wanted to know how many electoral votes were cast for our _what if_ scenario?
* We created an indicator variable which tells us if `clinton_johnson` had more votes than Trump.
* We can separate our data based on these levels and perform an operation on them using `group_by()`

```{r}
what_if %>% 
  group_by(clinton_win) %>% 
  summarise(ev_cast = sum(electoral_votes))
```
